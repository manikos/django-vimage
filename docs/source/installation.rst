Installation
============

You should **always** use a `virtualenv <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments>`_
or the recommended Python way, `pipenv <https://docs.pipenv.org/>`_. Whichever works best for you. Once you're inside your preferred virtual environment, run::

    (venv-name)$ pip install django-vimage
